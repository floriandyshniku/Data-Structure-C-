IQueryable<T> inherits from IEnumerable<T>, which means it shares all the querying capabilities of IEnumerable<T> and 
adds additional features specifically designed for querying data sources that support querying operations directly at the data source (like databases, web services, etc.).

The key difference between IQueryable<T> and IEnumerable<T> is how they execute queries.

IEnumerable<T> executes queries in-memory on collections that have already been loaded into memory. 
This means that all data is retrieved from the data source and loaded into memory before the query is executed.
IQueryable<T>, on the other hand, allows queries to be composed and executed remotely on the data source itself (if the data source supports it). 
This enables more efficient querying, as only the necessary data is retrieved from the data source, potentially reducing network traffic and memory consumption.
In Entity Framework, for example, LINQ queries against DbSet<T> (which implements IQueryable<T>) are translated into SQL queries and executed on the database server, allowing for efficient database access and manipulation.

In summary, IQueryable<T> provides a way to write and execute queries against data sources in a type-safe manner, with the ability to compose queries and execute them efficiently at the data source level.

IQueryable<T> and its usage with databases, it typically refers to the efficiency gained by executing queries directly on the database server rather than loading data into memory first.
By executing queries directly on the database server using IQueryable<T>, you can optimize your application's performance by minimizing network traffic and reducing memory usage, especially when dealing with large datasets.

An IQueryable is not actually a collection of entities, rather it describes how to obtain that collection. The data is never retrieved from the source until you evaluate it, by turning it into an IEnumerable or something similar.

The advantage of returning an IQueryable from your repository is that your calling code can specify additional .Where clauses BEFORE the query goes to the database. 
If you returned an IEnumerable, your code would retrieve all values of one table from the database, and then perform filtering in memory, which is inefficient.

-----Network traffic refers to the data that is transmitted over a network between two or more devices. This data can include various types of information, such as files, messages, requests, responses, and more.
 Network traffic can occur within a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or over the internet.  ----
