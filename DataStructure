IQueryable<T> inherits from IEnumerable<T>, which means it shares all the querying capabilities of IEnumerable<T> and 
adds additional features specifically designed for querying data sources that support querying operations directly at the data source (like databases, web services, etc.).

The key difference between IQueryable<T> and IEnumerable<T> is how they execute queries.

IEnumerable<T> executes queries in-memory on collections that have already been loaded into memory. 
This means that all data is retrieved from the data source and loaded into memory before the query is executed.
IQueryable<T>, on the other hand, allows queries to be composed and executed remotely on the data source itself (if the data source supports it). 
This enables more efficient querying, as only the necessary data is retrieved from the data source, potentially reducing network traffic and memory consumption.
In Entity Framework, for example, LINQ queries against DbSet<T> (which implements IQueryable<T>) are translated into SQL queries and executed on the database server, allowing for efficient database access and manipulation.

In summary, IQueryable<T> provides a way to write and execute queries against data sources in a type-safe manner, with the ability to compose queries and execute them efficiently at the data source level.
