String and StringBuilder are both used to work with text in .NET applications, but they have different characteristics and are used in different scenarios. Here are the main differences between them:

Immutability vs Mutability:
String: In .NET, strings are immutable, which means once a string object is created, it cannot be changed. 
Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string object. This can lead to performance issues when dealing with large amounts of string manipulation.
StringBuilder: StringBuilder, on the other hand, is mutable, meaning you can modify the contents of a StringBuilder instance without creating a new object each time. 
This makes StringBuilder more efficient for concatenating or modifying strings in situations where you need to perform many operations.

Performance:
String: Because strings are immutable, operations that involve modifying strings (such as concatenation with the + operator or using methods like String.Concat() or String.Format()) 
can result in the creation of many temporary string objects, which can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and performance.
StringBuilder: StringBuilder is optimized for situations where you need to perform many string concatenation or modification operations. 
It provides methods like Append() and Insert() to efficiently modify the contents of the string without creating unnecessary objects.

Usage:
String: String is typically used when you have a fixed string value that doesn't need to be modified frequently. For example, when working with constant strings or string literals.
StringBuilder: StringBuilder is used when you need to concatenate or modify strings dynamically, especially in loops or other situations where you need to perform many string manipulation operations.
