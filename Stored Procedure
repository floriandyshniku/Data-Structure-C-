Stored procedures are precompiled database routines that can be executed on the database server.
They are written in SQL and stored on the database itself. Here are some advantages of using stored procedures:

Performance optimization: Stored procedures can be optimized for performance by leveraging database-specific optimizations, such as indexing, query plan caching, and parallel execution. 
This can result in faster query execution times, especially for complex queries.
Security and data integrity: By granting appropriate permissions, developers can restrict direct access to tables and allow access only through stored procedures. 
This provides an additional layer of security and helps maintain data integrity.
Encapsulation and reusability: Stored procedures encapsulate complex business logic within the database, promoting code reusability and centralizing data manipulation operations. 
They can be called from multiple applications, reducing the need for duplicating code.
